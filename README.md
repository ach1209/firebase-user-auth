# firebase-user-auth
Using Firebase for user authentication

1 - Create Firebase project and add the necessary scripts to your project.<br/>
(<b>Note</b>: [Currently adding Firebase through npm leads to large bundle size](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/332))

2 - In Firebase console, under <b>Authentication</b> > <b>Sign-in method</b>, Email/Password must be enabled.

3 - Firebase Config keys can be found under <b>Project Settings</b> > <b>General</b> in the Firebase console
